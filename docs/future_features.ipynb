Accurate and efficient estimate of these sensitivities would allow options traders to buy the right amounts of options to hedge their stock positions from big swings in the asset prices (more on this later)."

Thus, the buyer of our option has the right but not obligation to buy 1000 shares of XYZ at just USD10 on expiration date (right now the option is deep in the money). If the delta of this call option is 0.5, this means that for every USD1 increase in stock price, the value of the call option goes up USD0.50 (to the holder).  To execute a delta hedge, the bank should buy 1000*.5=500 shares of XYZ. Now if the stock price goes down by USD1, the bank will lose USD500 on the stock position but will gain 0.5x1000=USD500 on its short call option position. Thus, the impact is neutral.  "
