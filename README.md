This project delivers an Automatic Differentiation Software package "DeltaPi" that calculates derivatives efficiently and accurately, making it useful across a wide spectrum of applications. In this package, we execute the forward mode of Automatic Differentiation. We will also provide an extension package HedgeDeltaPi that will calculate delta for European Call and Put options, allowing for efficient delta hedging.

The Package is installable at:
<https://pypi.org/project/DeltaPI-FantasticFour/>.   

Videos demionstrating how to use DeltaPi are included in the folder "Demo Movies".  The code can be found
